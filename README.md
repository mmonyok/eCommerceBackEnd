## Description
- Originally this program was missing its back end. 
- Using dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize, I fixed this problem by creating a robust database that properly Creates, Reads, Updates, and Deletes data in the various data tables. 
- Additionally, the data base now syncs and connects to the server, so it can be accessed by any frontend.
- I learned a lot about usingn sequelize to create and manage databases, as well as how to properly connect them to a server.

## Usage
- First, go into your MySQL shell and create the database with the command CREATE DATABASE {database name}; then run the command USE {database name}; to make sure it is the database in use.
- Then, within VS Code terminal, initialize npm and then install your node modules (dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize).
- Afterwards, create a .env file in the root folder and add your database name, user, and password to it in matching format to ./confic/connection.js.
